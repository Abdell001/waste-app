## General Information
  - This project solution aims to address the challenge of responsible consumption and production, which is the 12th UN Sustainable Development Goal. This goal is about ensuring that we use the world's resources in a sustainable and responsible way. We believe that waste management is a significant issue that needs to be addressed. In many areas, waste management is a serious problem since there is insufficient infrastructure and funding to collect and properly dispose of waste. This results in resource loss, environmental contamination, and health risks.
  - Our Software aims to create a more effective and sustainable waste management system while simultaneously presenting economic opportunities for people and communities. We specifically address Target 12.5, which is to substantially reduce waste generation through prevention, reduction, recycling, and reuse. We believe that this target is crucial because it promotes sustainable waste management practices that can help reduce environmental conntamination, health risks, and resource loss.
  - Furthermore, by connecting communities with businesses and vendors interested in buying waste, we aim educate people in treating waste as an asset and also to provide people with economic opportunities through waste recycling and reuse



## Technologies Used

## Project Status
Project is: _complete_


## Room for Improvement
Room for improvement:
- Use google to get user location(latitude,longitude)
- Use a SQL database for holding vendors information
- Use Spreadsheet to hold user information in spreadsheet format
- Live hosting
- Implement as an Android/IOS app


To do:
- Use Google Geolocation API for getting user location(latitude,longitude)
- Use Google SQL database for holding vendors information
- Use Google Spreadsheet API to hold user information in speadsheet
- Use Google Cloud Hosting service 
- Use flutter to deploy Android/IOS app
